## Notes

I'm personally not pleased with how this theme is setup.

At the time we implemented this teme we were facing a deadline and the parent theme was the closest we could find that 
had a feel we liked.

Lots of the options that Suffusion gives you we are not using and we'll never use.

Personally I would like to redo this entire theme, combine parent and child, starting with a starting theme like 
[FoundationPress](https://github.com/olefredrik/foundationpress), [JointsWP](https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP) or something similar.

So don't pay to much attention to the coding style and/or standards in this theme :)
